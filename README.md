# D2L.Services.Core.Postgres

This is a library that wraps Npgsql. It provides a simpler and easier way to interface with a Postgres database and adds additional functionality.

### Warning

Not all features of this library have been fully tested. Wait for version 1.0.0 to be completed before you depend on this.

### TODO:

**Version 1.0**

* Automated tests
* Document bugs and unexpected behaviour in Npgsql

**Version 1.1**

* Support for type converters
* Support for adding IEnumerable parameters (not just Array and IList)

**Version 1.2**

* Support transaction savepoints
* If possible, allow transactions to be marked as readonly/deferrable
